# wavesolve
`wavesolve` is a lightweight code to solve for the eigenmodes of waveguides. 
It uses the finite-element method, and generates waveguide meshes through the `pygmsh` package.

## installation
Use pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/jw-lin/wavesolve.git`

Dependencies: `numpy`,`scipy`,`matplotlib`,`numexpr`,`pygmsh`

## documentation
Admittedly a little sparse right now (but this will change in the future!). See `getting-started.ipynb` for an overview and some working examples.
